    <p>The photoelectric effect refers to the phenomenon in which electrons are emitted from a material's surface when it is exposed to light or other electromagnetic radiation. The photoelectric effect was discovered and first explained by German physicist Albert Einstein in 1905. Einstein's explanation of the phenomenon, which proposed that light consists of discrete particles called photons, earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921. His work on the photoelectric effect was a fundamental contribution to the development of quantum mechanics and the understanding of the particle-like nature of light. </p>
